# OBDFish
=========
This is an application for Sailfish OS, which connects to an OBD ELM327 car diagnostic reader.


See file TODO.txt for next planned implementation steps.

Disclaimer:
Each version of the application is testet on multiple vehicles to ensure it is working properly and will not cause any harm.
I cannot be held responsible for bricking your phone, vehicle, country, whatever...
