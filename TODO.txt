-------------BUGS/ERRORS-------------------
- Settings page: multiple errors:
	- if only one parameter is used and is changed, the change is not accepted and saved
	- the last parameter is somehow crap. There is even an error. This has something to do with supported values.
- Bluetooth devices: there is one saved as a ,																	-> fixed


--------------ToDo's for immediate future (before next release)---------------
- Repeat VIN request if not all data packets arrived. VW Caddy sometimes leaves out packet number 4!!!			-> should work now. Need to check this out...
- Each dynamic parameters page should have it's own settings page reachable via pull menu.						-> should work now. Need to check this out...
- In settings page, mark the supported/unsupported settings														-> should work now. Need to check this out...
- general settings page: query parameters in init routine on main page. Make parameters global.


--------------ToDo's for near future---------------
- Check MIL in init process on mainpage. If it is set, show a warning.
- Voltage should be choosable as parameter for dynamic pages.
- Add more PID's
- Add debug file which holds errors and problems detected by the software
- Add global settings page:
	- save communication with ELM327 to a file


--------------ToDo's for far future---------------

- Don't know what informations to view on the cover page. Need input...

- Make a VIN decoder (first only VW)
	- for every car brand an own JS library file
	- JS library has a generic function to decode
	- JS library has all lists which are needed to decode VIN. E.g. models, manufacturing date , ...

- Build in special PID requests, e.g. only working for Volkswagen
	- find a list of known PID's and how to deal with them

- Read trouble codes from PID area 0300
	- Problem is here that these codes might be manufacturer dependent.
	- I need to find out how to trigger a trouble code with my car.
	- The trouble codes should be viewed in a new dialog.

- Reset trouble codes
	- The ELM327 allows to reset triggered trouble codes.
	- Is this maybe manufacturer dependent? I won't do this if there is some chance of bricking the car controller!!!
	- Send a mode 04 command to the ELM. Do this only if there are trouble codes.
